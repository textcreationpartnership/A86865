            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Right Honourable.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen <hi>violent</hi> spirits are let loose, <hi>ambition</hi> mounts high, hatching their arils in the highest torrets, to dwell unbounded, and so draw Churches and States into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.</p>
            <p>If such dangerous enemies to the publick and private peace, be cockered, they will advance to touch the clouds, and cope with <hi>Juno</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla,</hi> could take no rest, till (by the terror of his legions) he was created <hi>Dictator,</hi> (by the Law <hi>Valerian</hi>) for eight years; As <hi>Caesar</hi> perpetuall, by the Law <hi>Servia.</hi> But the <hi>Empire</hi> gave neither of them rest from Trouble.</p>
            <p>The safest way to seek peace, is to refraine these <hi>Icarian</hi> thoughts, whose soaring wings, are ever laved in the depth of ruine.</p>
            <p>WEE therefore (<hi>the peaceable freeborn Subjects of</hi> England,) doe humbly Remonstrate unto your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114393:3"/> Honours the great danger of an unlimitted <hi>Presbytery,</hi> set in violent opposition to all other, peaceable and pious judgements.</p>
            <p>Let there be the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, but confine their <hi>Orders</hi> within an equall limit: and let not their projectments be above hope of effecting: And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what befell those braving builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> who would have raised too high a story: Let the foundation be laid (with love) on good ground, and the work will prosper better.</p>
            <p>Restraine the fury of Frenzied mindes, who are too violent: and with timely <hi>Moderation,</hi> let them be so bound in, and confined to that humility, and love, which Christ requires from the Church: as no aspiring thought may enter that Office, which becomes the Sons of peace: So shall we all enjoy more glorious peace in restraining, then inlarging the Clergy, and Elderships, to the motives of ambition, to have thoughts of setling the Church by answering all the desires of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and leave both the <hi>Episcopall</hi> and <hi>Congregationall</hi> parties, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unsatisfied in all their expectations, is like to <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> sports all day to catch flyes: and can (probably) produce no better ends, then the misty conclusions of the deluded <hi>Alchymist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To every action we are to propose a certain end: which being once attained, we are at rest.</p>
            <p>Thus doe we, Right Honourable, lay down <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> before your eyes, making it a subduer of all things, which fight against the peace of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The effects hereof are rare, and incomparable, it being a Vertue necessary, and well-deserving the acquaintance of your honours.</p>
            <p>Looke not scornfully upon us, because wee seeke for a <hi>Moderation</hi> in things; Oh it is an excellent ornament
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114393:3"/> for you, and will be your best Councellor (if follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for the peace of the Kingdome. Would any of you be great, and famous in the World, bee <hi>moderate</hi> and humble that will open to you a gate of glory: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>ambition</hi> is the high-way to ruine.</p>
            <p>Would you have great estates, be <hi>moderate</hi> in your places, that the Kingdome may be settled in a firme and lasting peace; That is the way to injoy plenty.</p>
            <p>Would you live in pleasure, and delight. Be <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and joyne all your hearts and hands, for an happy composure of all our differences, to Gods glory and the peace of the Land? that so wee may bee all joyned in love with one heart, to seeke the one onely ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</p>
            <p>And this will give you that inward and spirituall joy with the true peace of Conscience which none can take from you.</p>
            <div type="demands">
               <head>Now for the making of a way to this <hi>moderation</hi> in Church-government, wee doe humbly Remonstrate these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to the consideration of your honours (as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)</head>
               <p n="1">1 THat a Committee of some twelve learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moderate, pious, indifferent men, (whereof six to be Layicks) that are neither rigid <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor <hi>Independants,</hi> may bee chosen out of the Kingdome, to conferre with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and with the <hi>Independants,</hi> and receive their severall moddells of <hi>Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> and out of both to present to the Houses such a composure as may (so farre, as the word
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114393:4"/> of God will beare) give content to the Godly moderate parties on both sides: And all hope of loosnesse and Liberty to sinne, bee utterly taken away.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> (who is <hi>Moderator</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) may bee called Bishop of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> and so all others who shall be chosen in all the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the Kingdome? seeing that they have always confessed, that the names <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are all one, and (though nothing else be done in that particular, but giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to call the <hi>Moderator</hi> of every <hi>Province,</hi> a <hi>Bishop,</hi> yet) that will give great satisfaction to many, and stop a great quarrell in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> (and so still whosoever shall be hereafter) <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of the Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Divines, may be called <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> seeing that that place is the greatest of any of the Clergies in <hi>England.</hi> But that no more power may be given therein (as <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>) then is now, as <hi>Prolocutor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 That an Act may be passed, that no <hi>Bishop (alias Moderator</hi> of any <hi>Province,</hi> nor <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (alias Prolocutor)</hi> of the <hi>Generall Assembly,</hi> shall ever hereafter, by his place, be made a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> nor enjoy the Title of a <hi>Lord:</hi> Except by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114393:4"/> the common right of noble birth it fall to him, as it did to the late Honourable the Deceased Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> who lived, and dyed a preaching Minister, as well after his Lordship fell to him as before.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That the power of punishing sin, may be very severely by the Magistrate, and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given to all <hi>Justices of peace,</hi> and others, how all manner of punishments shall be inflicted upon all sorts of persons, for the severall sorts of sins, and those persons who are found guilty of any, to be the <hi>scandalous</hi> persons who are to be exempted the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> untill such time as they shall declare their repentance for the first offence before the Magistrate, for the second, before the Magistrate, the Minister, and Officers of the Church: and for the third offence (publickly) before the <hi>whole Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 That all such persons who are free from scandall; And shall confesse <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and their hope in him for <hi>salvation,</hi> may be admited to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> seeing that (by the rule of the <hi>Scripture</hi>) the rest of their Examination is to be by themselves, to which the <hi>Minister</hi> is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them by Instruction, adding the other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall parts, <hi>Reproofes</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 That all scandalous persons may be put out of the Eldership, both Clergy and Laity.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114393:5"/>8 That the King joyning with the Parliament, may have the Title formerly given to his Majesty, and to all the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> (who have beene stiled DEFENDORS OF THE FAITH) since <hi>Henry</hi> the eight first received it.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That no Minister or lay-elder, shall at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after upon pain of suspention) aske any maide or woman her bosome or darling sin, or infirmity, or goe about to purge any of them, of the sins of their thoughts, least thereby bee occasioned a temptation to loosenesse in knowing the lustfull actions or affections of such Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, in case they should (being guilty in such kind) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it to them.</p>
               <p n="10">10 That all godly Professors of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may go under one notion and bee protected by the power of Parliaments, and the Laws of the Land, to the stoppings and breakings out of factions. That so we may not quarrel for circumstances, but have a full joynt fruition of the substance of that <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion so long professed and practiced in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 That Congregations may be admitted to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, provided that they make choyce of such as are free from scandall and <hi>Heresie,</hi> and use no <hi>sinister</hi> meanes to traduce the people from the parochiall ministery, and that there bee no dividing of families, but that husband wife, parents, children, master, (and mistres, and servants all doe walke together.</p>
               <p n="12">12 That there may bee some course taken to settle a sufficient subsistance for all Parochiall Ministers of the Presbytery in all places through the Kingdome in such away as that the falling off of any of their Parishioners from them may not lessen their living now the collecting of their Anuities be so troublesome to them nor uncertaine, to occasion Suites, and vexations (by Tythes and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways) as hath been the custome in former times, but that a certainty of sufficient allowance may be confirmed to the Minister of every Parish in <hi>England.</hi>
